I am a Research Scientist at NYU Abu Dhabi interested in the applications of Machine Learning in astrophysics and planetary science, in addition to planet formation theory. 

My earlier research focused on the origins of the gas giants and their chemical composition, both for the solar system and exoplanets. 

I then became interested in using deep learning to map craters and boulders on the Moon and other objects, which eventually led to many other computer vision projects.
