Scientific facts are the common ground that all parts of society can agree on. In the last 10 years, I
was very active in outreach, delivering more than 100 hours of public talks, and organizing a large
number of diverse events in both France and Canada.<br><br>
<b>Universite de Franche-Comte &amp; Fabrika sciences (2014-2015):</b><br>
&bull; Weekly general public astronomy talks, both as co-organizer and speaker. These were fea-
tured in many local newspapers, an example is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
&bull; Many talks at local schools I visited (example in Fig. 5).<br>
&bull; European Researchers&rsquo; Night. I was in charge of giving visitors guided tour of the local
observatory.<br>

&bull; Solar eclipse event of March 2015. I helped setting up the telescopes, distributing solar
eclipse glasses, and most importantly giving multiple public talks on the science of eclipses.<br>

this space mission.<br>
